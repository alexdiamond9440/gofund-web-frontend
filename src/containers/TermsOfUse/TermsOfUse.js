        <span>4. How Projects Work</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          Most of our Terms of Use explain your relationship with GoFundHer. This section is
          different&mdash;it explains the relationship
        </span>
        <span>between creators and backers</span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;of GoFundHer projects, and who&rsquo;s responsible for what. This is what
          you&rsquo;re agreeing to when you create or back a GoFundHer project.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          GoFundHer provides a funding platform. When a creator posts a project on GoFundHer,
          they&rsquo;re inviting other people to form a contract with them. Anyone who backs a
          project is accepting the creator&rsquo;s offer, and forming that contract.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          GoFundHer is not a part of this contract&mdash;the contract is a direct legal agreement
          between creators and their backers. Here are the terms that govern that agreement:
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>When a project is successfully funded, </span>
        <span>the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward</span>
        <span>
          . Once a creator has done so, they&rsquo;ve satisfied their obligation to their backers.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Throughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest
          communication, and a dedication to bringing the project to life. At the same time, backers
          must understand that they&rsquo;re not buying something when they back a
          project&mdash;they&rsquo;re helping to create something new, not ordering something that
          already exists. There may be changes or delays, and there&rsquo;s a chance something could
          happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they&rsquo;ve failed
          to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every
          reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible
          conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met
          their obligations to backers if:
        </span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what
            prevents them from finishing the project as planned;
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible
            conclusion in a timeframe that&rsquo;s communicated to backers;
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            they&rsquo;re able to demonstrate that they&rsquo;ve used funds appropriately and made
            every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised;
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            they&rsquo;ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their
            communication to backers; and
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward
            (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to
            complete the project in some alternate form.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span>
          The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If
          they&rsquo;re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal
          action by backers.
        </span>

        <span>5. How Funding Works</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          This section goes over the details of backing and creating projects&mdash;things like how
          money gets collected, whether pledges can be changed or canceled, and how creators can
          contact backers to provide rewards.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>These are the terms that apply when you&rsquo;re </span>
        <span>backing a project</span> <span>:</span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>In some cases we&rsquo;ll reserve the charge on your card.</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;GoFundHer and its payment partners may authorize or reserve a charge on your
            credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full pledge,
            at any time between the pledge and the collection of funds.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>The estimated delivery is the creator&rsquo;s </span> <span>estimate.</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;The month and year listed on each reward is the creator&rsquo;s estimate of when
            they will provide the reward&mdash;not a guarantee to fulfill by that time. The schedule
            may change as the creator works on the project. We ask creators to think carefully, set
            an estimated delivery they feel confident they can work toward, and communicate with
            backers about any changes.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>The creator may need to send you questions about your reward.</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;To deliver rewards, the creator might need information from you, like your mailing
            address or t-shirt size. They&rsquo;ll request that information after the campaign has
            succeeded. To receive the reward, you&rsquo;ll need to provide the information in a
            reasonable amount of time. Creators should not ask for personal information that is not
            necessary to provide your reward, and should never request sensitive personal
            information such as your Social Security number or payment information. Contact us at
            info@GoFundHer.com if you receive a request for information that seems inappropriate or
            excessive.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>GoFundHer doesn&rsquo;t offer refunds.</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;Responsibility for finishing a project lies entirely with the project creator.
            GoFundHer doesn&rsquo;t hold funds on creators&rsquo; behalf, cannot guarantee
            creators&rsquo; work, and does not offer refunds.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span>These are the terms that apply when you&rsquo;re </span>
        <span>creating a project:</span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>You can refund individual pledges if you want.</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;After your project has been funded, you can cancel and refund a backer&rsquo;s
            pledge at any time. If you do, you have no further obligation to that specific backer,
            and no agreement exists between you.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>We&rsquo;ll charge our fees before putting funds in your account.</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;GoFundHer and its payment partners will subtract fees before transmitting the
            proceeds of a campaign.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Some pledges can&rsquo;t be collected, which might reduce the amount of funding you get.
          </span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;Because some payments can&rsquo;t be collected&mdash;for instance, when a
            backer&rsquo;s credit card expires before funding ends, and they don&rsquo;t provide
            updated information&mdash;we can&rsquo;t guarantee that the amount of funding you
            receive will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus fees.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>We&#39;ll help resolve payment-card disputes.</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;If a backer of your project disputes the charge with their card issuer, we&#39;ll
            handle re-presenting the charge to settle the dispute with the card issuer. You&rsquo;ll
            be notified that a dispute has been filed, and you&rsquo;ll be able to provide evidence
            to help us resolve it in your favor. If the cardholder&rsquo;s dispute is found valid,
            you authorize us to charge the credit card number you provided when you started your
            project for the amount of the chargeback.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Prepare for potential delays.</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t assume you&rsquo;ll be able to launch your project when you want;
            there could be a reason we&rsquo;re not able to accept it, or a problem that takes time
            to resolve. Don&rsquo;t assume you&rsquo;ll be able to immediately collect your funding;
            there may be a delay between the end of a successful campaign and your access to the
            funds. And don&rsquo;t take any actions in reliance on collecting any of the money
            pledged until you actually have the ability to withdraw it from your account and spend
            it.

          We don&#39;t own the content you post on GoFundHer, but we do have your permission to use
          or copy it however we need. We generally use it to promote projects and showcase our
          community. Ultimately, you&#39;re responsible for the content you post, and you&#39;re

            exercise, commercialize, and exploit the copyright, publicity, trademark, and database
            rights with respect to your Content. In general, we use this Content to promote projects
            and showcase our community on the website. There are many factors that we take into
            consideration before featuring a project on the homepage or giving it a Project We Love
            badge. This includes, but is not limited to, a crisp project image with no logos,
            badges, or text on top, a clear and detailed description that includes a thorough plan
            for completing your project, captivating images or videos, an excited community, what we
            think different users will be interested in, and of course, a lot of creativity. In
            addition to giving some projects a Project We Love badge, we also carefully curate the
            homepage to highlight great examples of GoFundHer projects. The projects at the very top
            of the homepage typically are best-of-the-best Projects We Love&mdash;based on factors

          days in advance, unless we&rsquo;re canceling for reasons related to illicit or
          inappropriate content, the safety of a good or service, counterfeiting, fraud, malware,

          After GoFundHer receives your counter-notification, we&#39;ll forward it to the copyright
          owner. If we do not receive a notice within 10 business days after forwarding the
          counter-notification that the owner has filed an action seeking a court order to prevent
          further infringement, GoFundHer may reinstate the project at issue.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Access to your project or to the infringing material will remain disabled after we receive
          your counter-notification until the dispute is resolved or until 10 business days have
          passed without notification that the owner has filed an action seeking a court order.
          During this time, you will still have the option to message your backers, edit your
          project, or cancel your project.

        <span>Will anyone see my DMCA notification or counter-notification?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          GoFundHer is committed to transparency in disabling access to users&#39; content. We will
          publish a copy of each DMCA notification and counter-notification on our site.
          Personally-identifying information such as the claimant&#39;s name, email and telephone
          number will be removed from notifications and counter-notifications before they are
          published. However, a claimant&rsquo;s address and company name (if provided) will be
          posted publicly.
        </span>

          If a project you&rsquo;ve backed becomes the subject of a copyright dispute and GoFundHer
          removes part or all of the project from public view, you&rsquo;ll get an email that
          explains the status and next steps. Any material that becomes subject to a copyright
          dispute will be removed until the dispute is resolved or the DMCA process is complete. If
          a project or any of its contents are removed because of a dispute, you&#39;ll still be
          able to manage your pledge by going to the project page.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          If we aren&#39;t able to re-post the project within 30 days, we will cancel it, all pledge
          authorizations will expire, and the project will be permanently unavailable. If, on the
          other hand, the dispute is resolved or the DMCA process resolves within 30 days, the
          project will be restored to public view. We&rsquo;ll update you by email if any of these
          steps are taken.
