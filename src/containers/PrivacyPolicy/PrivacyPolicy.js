      <h2>What We Collect and Receive</h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          In order for you to create an account on GoFundHer and use our Services, we need to
          collect and process certain information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may
          include:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            Information you provide by completing forms on GoFundHer &mdash; your name, email and
            postal addresses, telephone number, country of residence, login, and password details.
            We may ask for this information if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe to
            our newsletters, upload or submit content through GoFundHer, or if you contact us;

            Information you provide for identity verification purposes when launching a project,
            including your legal name, business name and Tax ID for business entities, and date of
            birth. In some cases, our payment processor will request that you provide a secure
            upload of an identity document (such as your passport, drivers license or other
            government-issued ID) to GoFundHer;

      <h2>How We Use This Information</h2>
      <p>
        <span>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            To keep your account secure and protect our Services (including to verify the identities
            of creators and prevent fraud and abuse);
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            To enable us to provide you with our Services, and to improve and promote our Services;
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            To create and administer your account, contact you, and customize your experience on
            GoFundHer (for example, to show you projects that we think may interest you based on
            your previous use); and
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            To track and analyze use of the Services so that we can improve how GoFundHer is
            performing and provide users with the best experience possible.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>European Union Users</h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          Data protection law in Europe requires a &ldquo;lawful basis&rdquo; for collecting and
          retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area.
          Our lawful bases include:
        </span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your
            personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services, enable
            creators to establish and display their projects, and enable backers to find and make
            pledges to them.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data. For
            example, tax laws require us to retain records of pledges and payments made through our
            Services.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially
            means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not
            hurt your interests and rights. We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate
            interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and
            that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
            <br />
            <br /> For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud
            and abuse and to keep the Services secure. We may also send you promotional
            communications about our Services, subject to your right to control whether we do so.
            <br />
            <br /> We analyze how users interact with our Site so we can understand better what
            elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well. This allows
            us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.
            <br />
            <br />

      </ul>
      <h2>How This Information Is Shared</h2>
      <h3>Information that&rsquo;s shared publicly</h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          When you create an account, we create a basic profile page for you on GoFundHer,
          containing your username, the date the account was created, and a list of projects you
          have backed or launched. By default, your profile is private and you can choose to make it
          public in your account settings. Your username appears with the comments you post and
          messages you send on GoFundHer and, if your profile is set to public, people can click
          your username to view it. If you make your profile public, others will be able to see the
          following things:
        </span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>The account username you select, and the date the account was created;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Any information you choose to add to your profile (like a picture, bio, or your
            location);
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Projects you&rsquo;ve backed (but not pledge amounts or rewards chosen);</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Projects you&rsquo;ve created;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Comments you&rsquo;ve posted on GoFundHer; and</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>If you have &ldquo;Liked&rdquo; a project update.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span>
          Creators are also asked to verify their identities before launching a project. Once this
          has been done, the creator&rsquo;s Verified Name will be publicly displayed on their
          account profile and on any projects they launch.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>Information that isn&rsquo;t shared publicly</h3>
      <p>
        <span>The following data will not be publicly displayed or revealed to other users:</span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>Any payment information you provide;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Your password details;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Your IP address;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Your phone number;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Your date of birth and other identity verification documentation (for creators);
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Private profile information, in accordance with your preferences; and</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions
            or comments, or report a problem);
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Information that&rsquo;s shared with trusted third-party services</h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          We may share your information with certain trusted third-party services to help us
          provide, improve, promote, or protect GoFundHer&rsquo;s Services (like when we partner
          with payment processors, or use services that help us manage our ads on other sites). When
          we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the GoFundHer
          Services, we require that they use your information only for the purposes we&rsquo;ve
          authorized, and that they protect your personal information at least to the same standards
          we do. We may also share information that&rsquo;s aggregated and anonymized in a way that
          it doesn&rsquo;t directly identify you.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>Information that&rsquo;s shared with creators and collaborators</h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          When you back a project, the project&rsquo;s creator will know your username, the amount
          you have pledged, and the reward you have selected. Creators never receive backers&rsquo;
          credit card details or other payment information.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          If a project you have backed is successfully funded, the creator will receive the email
          address associated with your GoFundHer account. They may also send you a survey requesting
          information needed to provide your reward. (For instance, they may need your mailing
          address, or T-shirt size.) Any information you provide in such surveys will be received by
          the creator.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Creators are required to keep backer information confidential, except as strictly
          necessary to communicate with backers directly and fulfill rewards. Creators should not
          ask for personal information that isn&rsquo;t necessary to provide your reward, and should
          never request sensitive personal information such as your Social Security number or
          payment information. Contact us at info@GoFundHer.com if you receive a request for
          information that seems inappropriate or excessive.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Collaborators are third parties that creators can appoint to help manage their project.
          These collaborators may be able to access the information available to creators (including
          backers&rsquo; names, email addresses, pledge amounts, reward selections, messages, and
          survey responses), and are required to treat backers&rsquo; personal information with the
          same care and respect as creators are.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Creators and their collaborators may also receive routine traffic analytics about their
          project pages.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>Information that&rsquo;s shared to protect GoFundHer and comply with the law</h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is
          reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse,
          or to protect GoFundHer&rsquo;s legal rights, property, or the safety of GoFundHer, its
          employees, users, or others.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>Links to other websites and services</h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          Our Site may include links to other websites or services whose privacy practices may
          differ from GoFundHer&rsquo;s. When you use a link to an external site or service, the
          privacy policy and data processing disclosures for that site or service governs.

      </p>
      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          We will retain your information as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide
          you with the Services or as otherwise set forth in this Policy. We will also retain and
          use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and to the
          extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our
          agreements and protect GoFundHer&rsquo;s legal rights.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized information which we
          may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Site, improve our
          Services or comply with legal obligations.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          Because GoFundHer is a US-based company, your information will be collected and processed
          in the United States. The United States has its own laws governing data protection and
          government access to information. The rules that protect your personal information under
          United States law may be different than in your home country. If you choose to use the
          Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between
          GoFundHer and its users.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          Users residing in certain countries, including the EU, are afforded certain rights
          regarding their personal information. Except where an exception or exemption applies,
          these rights include the ability to access, correct, and request deletion of your personal

        <span>
          Please note that the CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that

      <p>
        <span>
          Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California
          law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Services to you. We

          You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to subject certain requests of
          your behalf. To verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your
          behalf, we may require them to provide us with a signed written authorization or a copy of
          a power of attorney.
